    <h4>Introduction to Web Development</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt about the different positions in web development; the difference between front end developers versus back end and the basics of how project management might work in a project-led dev setting. ....</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>It has provided an excellent base to help launch research on working and potential entry-level positions in this industry.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>It's hard packing a lot of information into a relatively short training session on Teams but I'm reassured that much of what we touch on will become clearer in context as we become more knowledgable and experienced.</p>

    <p>We have used this in a fairly limited way so far.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
